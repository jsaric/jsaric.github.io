I am a PhD student in Computer Vision at 
Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, 
University of Zagreb. My advisor and life coach is [Siniša Šegvić](http://www.zemris.fer.hr/~ssegvic/).

My current research focuses on future anticipation in driving scenarios.
The ability of machines to anticipate and reason about the future
could be crucial in development and integration of autonomous driving systems.
I am also interested in efficient image recognition models.

In my free time I like to hang out with my friends, ride a bike and attend a pub quiz with my fantastic team.
Now, I hope to publish some interesting posts on my blog about computer vision and stuff.
